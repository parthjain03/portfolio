      detailedDescription: 'thrustMIT\'s flagship entry for the Spaceport America Cup 2024, AgniAstra was designed to reach an apogee of 30,000 feet with a maximum velocity of 1.7 Mach. As Team Leader and Structural Design Engineer, I managed overall design and fabrication of the airframe and internal components, including innovative CO₂ deployment and recovery mechanisms. The rocket achieved an apogee of 17,010 feet before experiencing structural failure due to wind shear at MaxQ. Utilized ANSYS simulations and analytical methods to ensure structural integrity.',
